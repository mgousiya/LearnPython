# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported Or run stand alone)
#                        functions & classes in this module can be reused
#                        without the main block of code executing

#Good Practise (code is modular, 
#               helps readability,
#               leaves no global variables,
#               avoid unintended execution)

#       Ex. library = import library for functionality
#       When running library directly, display a help page
